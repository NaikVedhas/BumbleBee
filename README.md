# Bumble Bee

 <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
Sweet little bumblebee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Sweet little bumblebee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
My heart skips a beat
When you walk in the room
I go, boom, boom, boom
You go, zoom, zoom, zoom
You're my playboy, play toy
Love you, my friend
I wanna be with you until the end
I give my heart and my soul to you
To make you see it's true
I'm so confused, baby, can't you see?
Please come rescue me
Sweet little bumblebee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Sweet little bumblebee
