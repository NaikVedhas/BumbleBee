# Bumble Bee

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet little bumblebee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Sweet little bumblebee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da
My heart skips a beat
When you walk in the room
I go, boom, boom, boom
You go, zoom, zoom, zoom
