# Bumble Bee

<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
<p>Sweet little bumblebee</p>
<p>I know what you want from me</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>Sweet little bumblebee</p>
<p>More than just a fantasy</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>My heart skips a beat</p>
<p>When you walk in the room</p>
<p>I go, boom, boom, boom</p>
<p>You go, zoom, zoom, zoom</p>
<p>You're my playboy, play toy</p>
<p>Love you, my friend</p>
<p>I wanna be with you until the end</p>
<p>I give my heart and my soul to you</p>
<p>To make you see it's true</p>
<p>I'm so confused, baby, can't you see?</p>
<p>Please come rescue me</p>
<p>Sweet little bumblebee</p>
<p>I know what you want from me</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>Doo-bi-doo-bi, doo-da-da</p>
<p>Sweet little bumblebee</p>
